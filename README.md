I'm using this as an oppurtunity to learn how to write websites and share what I am working on or want to work on. 
Message me if interest!

Update:
Right now, I am a data scientist at CedarGate, a health IT startup. In addition, I do research under the PI Vucetic at Temple University and am a full time student. No time for fun websites now!
