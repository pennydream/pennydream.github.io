        <h1>Ideas on Presenting </h1>
        <p>Over this past weekend, I flew out to San Diego to attent the Society for Neuroscience 2016 confrence. It was the first time I attended an academic confirence, and I was presenting a poster on work I did at Dr. Thomas Gould's lab over the year I was there. I presented the poster with a close freind on mine who I worked with at Gould lab and now currently live with, so it was a great time. We both were a bit overwhelmed by the first two days of the confirence, but the dust settled once we presented. 
        So, if you're presenting a poster for the time, I got some things to say. First, if you're anything like me, you're nervous. That's fine and normal and doesn't mean you'll be nervous during the actual presentation. There were a couple things that really helped me out, but of course, actually presenting is only only way to actually prepare. With that said, the academic atmosphere can be scary and you should prep a bit. 
        First off, talk to people. Talk to everyone who will listen. Talk to people who know are intensly aware of the feild you are in, talk to people who are superficially aware of the feild you are in, and talk to people who don't know what the fuck you do. When talking to those whoe don't know the feild, reiterate the desire to communicate what you. Cut off the fat of your ideas, but don't leave anything important out. Make sure you set up your narrative just right so that they understand your goals and ideas and how your work supports them. When talk to those who are very inside the feild, beg them to ask as many questions as possible. These confirences are notorious for hosting a select group of individuals who will tear you apart with questions. Be ready for this; predict what they will ask and answer it with backup from literature. Script your responces, and ask those in the field to make you aware of any holes in your theories, models, or data. Be ready to go on the defence when someone else goes on the offence, and feel confident that you will be able to answer any answerable questions. 
        This leads well into the other side of this intense questioning. You must be ok with saying that you do not know. All academic feilds hold huge wealths of data, and as a single person, it is impossible to know it all. Also, research has it's limits. There is only so much we collectively know and understand, so if you are making a prediction or speculation, say prefice it with an ackowledgement that nobody knows if what you say is true. Also, when dealing with data and statistics, be clear about trends, significance, correlation, ect... I did have to spit out a p-value once, but that is usually unnecessary unless you have a p=0.05 and your ANOVA or t-test or whatever gave you a very close p. In my case, it was p=0.055, so the trend was certainly close and most just accepted it for what it is instead of dwelling on the posibility of a statistical flounder. 
        So, besides talking to people and preparing answers to questions, you must read the literature. This maybe should have gone first, but it seems obvious enough that you probably should have done it already. If you are or are going to be an author on an academic paper, it is (and rightfully so) assumed you understand the feild beyond a superficial level. Make sure this is true. Every feild has areas of untouched research. Look for these and be able to lay out the downsides and upsides of future research ideas. If you have a model for a behaviour or neural system, understand why this is the way it is. Know why you did what you did. This does not mean you must have a plethora of papers ready to cite at any time, but know generally where it came from. Maybe read and be able to cite reviews on the topics, so that people can look them up later. Also, be ok with giving out your contact information so you can send out links and copies of relevant research.
        This is the last part. I was actually pretty unprepared for this. Make some sort of sign up sheet so people can give you their name, email, school affiliation, and any thing they want to be sent. Consider making cards to give out to people, or even have a set of index cards to give to people with your name, email, and affiliciation. If you're looking for a position, like for grad school, postdoc, or even faculty, just make business cards. It will be worth it, and you will have them for the future. In fact, I'm going to do that now. 
        So, basically, talk to a shit load of people, prepare questions, do your research on the background, and be ready to make some contacts. After actually presenting to the first few groups or inidividuals, you will realize what you need to say so people react well. These people really are just as scared as you are, because, you are infact the best expert on your own research. No one else knows it like you do, so get out there and tell 'em.</p>
