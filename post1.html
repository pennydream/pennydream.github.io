	<h1>Nothing new here. Nothing to learn from. No realizations but the lack thereof.</h1>
	<p>I have spent very little time completing actual tasks. I spend hours learning and reading with no clear end goal in sight. Would it be more productive to just sit back awhile until a viable goal comes to mind or into my vision? I doubt that, but I doubt the opposite as well.</p>
	<p>The internet, the web, the good ol' world wide! So much potencial! Unlimited potencial! If only we had something to do with all that potencial!!!!</p>
	<p>I'm turning 21 in about a week. Here in the great United States of America, that means I can legally purchase and consume alcohol. The nectar of the gods. And with bars in my sight, I move forward. Smile smile smile. I just don't want to get too fucked up! Can't start blabbering about how I really feel. Might lose some friends. But that's silly. I don't know why people are so obsessed over consuming alcohol. I mean, its strong, no doubt about that, but it really isn't that enjoyable. The after effects are so shitty. I never really enjoyed it, but almost find it necessary at big social gathers, especially at night. Maybe I only find it necessary because it has been so ingrained in out culture and our biology. But it's not healthy!!! At least not for our bodies. But our social status, oh my, again, its a nectar of the gods!</p>
	<p>Maybe I'll continue to post here. This page is run on git pages, so it would be nice to keep blogging here just so I don't forget git or html. And maybe I'll even learn something new to put up here. But again. No end in sight. Gotta find a product or something useful people want. Or maybe just wait to see what people tell me they want. We'll see.</p>
	<p>Until tomorrow</p>
