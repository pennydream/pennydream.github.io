	<title>A New Horizon, Wasting Time</title>

	<h1>Lots of new horizons. I whine too much.</h1>
	<p>I spend hours learning and reading about code outside of the
classroom. Would it be more productive to just sit back awhile until a viable
goal comes to mind or into my vision? The internet, the web, the good ol' world
wide! So much potencial! Unlimited potencial! This gives me hope.</p>
	<p>I'm turning 21 in about a week. Smile smile smile. I'm excited to get together with a bunch of people.</p>
	<p>But for now I have to familiarize myself with the NARS gui for the artificial intellegence project I am learning about.</p>
	<p>Maybe I'll continue to post here. This page is run on git pages, so it would be nice to keep blogging here just so I don't forget git or html. And maybe I'll even learn something new to put up here. But no end in sight. Gotta find a product or something useful people want. Or maybe just wait to see what people tell me they want. We'll see. Javascript is my next step in DIY web developement.</p>
	<p>Until tomorrow</p>
