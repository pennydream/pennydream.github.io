        <h1>Brendan Garrett's Web Presense</h1>
        <h2>I am a person!</h2>
        <p>Welcome! <em>I am actually a very specific human being.</em>
		On a professional side, my life is split between research and academia. I currently do neuroscience research at the <a href="http://sites.temple.edu/parikh/">NECO Lab</a> at Temple University. 
		Separately, I am doing some data analysis via machine learning for prediction of depression under Lauren Alloy, PhD.
		I have worked in <a href = "pastLabs.html">other labs</a> as well and have <a href = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27421892">a publication I am proud of.</a>
		I am <em>still</em> an undergraduate - Neuroscience & Computer Science major.</p>
	    <p><br>On my personal side, I am obsessed about learning. I'm usually reading three books at any given time, at least one fiction and one nonfiction. Some didactic, some philosophy, some just to chill.
		    I'm an avid podcast listener. My main ones are Radiolab, StuffYouShouldKnow, TimFerrisShow, SleepWithMe, and I've just been getting into CommonSense with Dan Carlin from hardcore history.
		    Arguing about politics is my idea of a good time. I try to pay attention to things, mostly at a national and international level. This is done by reading the Economist and books like World Order by Kissinger.
		    I am currently trying to get back into barbell training after a four month hiatus from traveling. I used to do a variation of 3x5 Starting Strength, but I'm looking to get into a PPL routine to build muscle.
		    	I started about 8 months before my break. Current stats: 235 squat, 285 deadlift, 145 bench. It has become one of the most enjoyable aspects of my life.
		    I am just starting to get into meal prepping, which has helped cut back on cooking time. With that said, I also love cooking, so I try to do something different each week. Inspired mostly by Alton Brown.
		    I have been playing guitar for almost a decade now and enjoy singing and writing. I've always needed a musical instrument on hand. I also fiddle around with piano, bass, trumpet, ect..</p>

	    <h3>Projects: 
	    </h3>
	    <p><br>I work a lot, so here is where I plan to write down bits about each project I am working on.</p>
	    <p><a href = "projects/probGNG.html">Probabily in Go/NoGo trials</a>: here I am analysing rat behavior patterns to find differences in cognitive flexability in young and aged groups. Come here if you're good at probability theory or computational modeling.</p>
	    <p><a href = "/histGeneralUse.py">General Use Bar Graph Creator</a>: I made a general use histograph/bar graph creator file for the future, using Matplotlib in Python. Instructions are layed out simply for non-coders. Feel free to use it for your aesthetic graphing needs.</p>

	    <p><br>I read a lot, so here is where I plan to write down bits about each book I read.</p>
	    <p>I just finished the <a href = 'https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000'>Checklist Manifesto</a> by Atul Gawande. <a href = 'books/checklistManifesto.html'>Notes Here.</a></p>
