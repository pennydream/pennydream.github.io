	<h1>From Biochemistry to Neuroscience and Back</h1>
	<p> As a freshman, I wanted to find a career that was moral, acceptable, rewarding, all that shit I didn't understand but kept hearing adults talk about.</p>
  <p>I felt like science research was for me, and nothing was more broad and complex than biochemistry, so that was where I began. Starry eyed and makin' moves.</p>
  <p>After just two semesters, I landed a summer internship at a lab in University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine. This was intense.</p>
  <p>Most freshman could not find labs that wanted to teach them, probably because they were idealistic shmucks. I wasn't any different, but got lucky and knew people.</p>
  <p>So I spent the summer of 2014 commuting to and from my parent's house.</p>
  <p>The commute alone should be on my resume. I drove about 30 minutes to a train station, took a 90 minute regional rail ride to Philly's 30th Street Station, and walked 1.3 miles to the lab.</p>
  <p>I completed this triathalon twice a day totaling about 4 hours of commuting. I thought working fourty hours a week was rough, but this easily made it sixty.</p>
  <p>Regardless, this lab is where I began to face the realities of research. The P.I. had been working on essencially the same protein pathway his entire life.</p>
  <p>The guy had put so much time and effort into trying to find a pharmaceutical solution to halting part of the body's innate immute responce to foreign cells.</p>
  <p>This would give rise to easier organ transplants, and as many people know, organs are rare and hard to get, so making every single one work out is important.</p>
  <p>So, I was amazed at the dedication. About a dozen people worked six to seven days a week, ten to twelve hour days, every single moment, trying to figure this out.</p>
  <p>We rant western blots, ELISAs, cell cultures, and other protocol to find out want happened in the pathway when giving mice, rats, and non-human primates certain drugs.</p>
  <p>I got to get my hands dirty. I was quickly brought up to speed about the theory and started running ELISAs and gels to study proteins within a week or two.</p>
  <p>I didn't realize how important this experience was at the time. Many undergrads are not given the oppurtunity to touch these tests until they prove their ability.</p>
  <p>So, I spent the next three months learning many protocol for how to find out what kinds of proteins are in a sample, how much of each type, and how to manipulate this.</p>
  <p>All in all, I definitely contributed, but it was all such a rush. The big picture of the projects I was on was way too big for me. Nothing seemed real or possible. The goal was too far away.</p>
  <p>So, I started search for other feilds. I knew that most of biochemistry and pharmaceutical research was slow, the pay was ok but usually one gets a PhD. That means four to seven more years after undergrad.</p>
  <p>It was obvious to leave, but so difficult to know where to go.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>My process was not as hard headed as one would expect. I looked at other science research feilds. I found interest in introspection and learning about the workings of my own mind.</p>
  <p>I became more and more obsessed about this as I researched psychology, but I knew the most psychology majors did not do research. Many would not get into or go to grad school.</p>
  <p>Psych just seemed a bit more loose. Neuroscience, on the other hand, was more of a hard science. And the turn around for research was much faster!</p>
  <p>I wanted to be able to view my work changing others in real time. I needed that concrete difference feeling that most biochemistry research lacked. So I went into neuroscience.</p>
  <p>As I look back, biochemistry is applied within neuroscience, so whichever major I chose, I could have gone either way. But it was a perspective flip. I had more defined goals and had learned what I wanted.</p>
