	<h1>A useful tool and nothing more</h1>
  <p>This book was simple and didactic. It was written by an MD and surgeon who had been approached by the World Health Organization to help with the many issues that occur in surgery rooms accross the world.</p>
  <p>The author, Dr. Gawande, did not know how to approach the situation as it was so complex. Each potencial issue was driven by context of the hospital, the world region, and the group of people doing the surgery.</p>
  <p>So, spoiler alert, he proposes using a checklist. This position is defended by a handful of case studies of other industries. Gawande goes into detail about how the checklist is used in both aerospace and construction.</p>
  <p>In construction, a checklist brings all teams and individuals up to speed, forms a schedule, and informs one when they should break the chain of command if an issue arrises.</p>
  <p>In aerospace, a checklist quickly informs pilots and staff how to respond in emergencies. It is highly abreviated. It is a great lesson in applied minimalism.</p>
  <p>Gawande tries to bridge these two ideas in his WHO surgery checklist, which you can see <a href = "http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44186/2/9789241598590_eng_Checklist.pdf">HERE.</a></p>
  <p>This checklist attempts to balance the potencial state of emergency (RE: the need to be breif) and the balance of power and duty in a surgery room.</p>
  <p>A good amount of the insite in this section applies mostly to a surgery room, but it is interesting. There are balances of power in most work environments, so taking them into account is worthwhile.</p>
  <p>There is something to be said for the construction checklist, as well, which defended the idea that a manager does not have to have complete authority over his/her underlings, and that such power is antithetical to the job at hand.</p>
  <p>When someone tries to control another, it takes away the ability for the controlled to actually do any work. I don't mean this in a solely creative sense, either.</p>
  <p>If a bricklayer is told how to lay each and every brick, the controller might as well be laying the bricks himself.</p>
  <p>Outside of the workspace, the checklist is used constantly for practical purposes. I normally write does outlines of my schedule before I go through, so having this editing knowledge is nice.</p>
  <p>I could just tell you to be concise, abreviate when you know the reading will understand, and allow yourself to move through one step at a time, but reading this book will certainly reenforce that more.</p>
